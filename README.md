I am looking to use data to help businesses improve their sales. My skills include advanced Excel, SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Power BI and Python.

Currently I am mastering my new skills in data analystics through the TripleTen BI and Data Analytics bootcamp, while working sales for a local company in my hometown of Colorado Springs. I enrolled in the bootcamp in August of 2024 and will complete it by December 2024 with skills in SQL, Tableau, Python and Power BI. I also completed a number of in-depth practical projects that have provided me with real-world knowledge and experience. My goal is to transition into the data analystics field within the next 8-months.

Some facts about me:
- I am passionate about sports and would like to work in the business or sports business spheres.
- I am very active and love spending time outdoors and with friends and family.
- I am an avid golfer and passionate about the sport overall.
- My goals for the remainder of 2024 and for 2025: complete my TripleTen journey and find my dream job in BI and data.
